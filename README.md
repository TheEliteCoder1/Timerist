Philosophy
===
Students of which I am, have a lot of different things that we ought to complete by the end of each day. Although completing all of our tasks may seem easy, completing them with quality and staying without stress takes quite some more effort. Remembering everything that we have to do in our brains is not efficient and most of the time leads to poor quality work and stress on students and individuals. Staying organized, stressless, and completing all that we have to do on time can be done through Timerist. Timerist organizes your day but allowing you to set tasks and assign them due dates that have an alarm and countdown. Notes and documents can be used for completing homework, breaking down a problem, and writing down a thought into text. Timerist's rich assistance to the brain's ability to remember and prioritize things will greatly benefit one's responsibility and success.

Running the Application from Source
===
### Running from source (Windows):
Make sure that you have 'pip' installed on your system, and that you have added it to your Python path.
If you have completed the step above, you may move on to completing the steps below.
Open up your terminal, and type or paste in the following:
1. `git clone "https://github.com/DaEliteCoder/Timerist.git"`
2. `cd Timerist`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python -u app.py`
---
#### Optional: To check if the dependencies were installed properly, type or paste in the following in your terminal: 
`pip freeze`
### Running from source (MacOS / Linux):
Make sure that you have 'pip' installed on your system, and that you have added it to your Python path.
If you have completed the step above, you may move on to completing the steps below. Remember, Python version 2 is pre-installed on your operating system, so you will have to say pip3 and python3 to specify that you're not using version 2.
Open up your terminal, and type or paste in the following:
1. `git clone "https://github.com/DaEliteCoder/Timerist.git"`
2. `cd Timerist`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python3 -u app.py`
---
#### Optional: To check if the dependencies were installed properly, type or paste in the following in your terminal: 
`pip3 freeze`
