<h4>An application that will help students organize their day at school :)</h4>

#### My Codebase Structure:
| Folder/File   | Purpose       
| ------------- |:-------------:
| Resource      | The Resource package is a utility composed of modules, classes, & functions that can help us easily break down implementations for GUI. 
| database      | A folder database that handles the notes created by the user in the application.      
| images        | A folder that contains image resources for the application.
| README.md     | A markdown file describing our application, and the underlying source code that works behind the scenes to help the user organize their day at school.
| alarm.gif     | A gif file that is shown when one of the tasks that the user has created in the "to do" section, has not been completed by the assigned date and time.
| alarm.wav     | A wav file that is played alongside the "alarm.gif" file to show the user that the time is up, and that they need to complete their task as soon as possible to stay on time.
| app.py        | A module that combines all other source files, and runs the application.
