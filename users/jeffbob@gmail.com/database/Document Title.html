They can all agree that the most important thing in school is their academic success alongside their friendships with classmates. Both of these things can be greatly achieved in virtual and face-to-face school. Why then should they prefer virtual school over the other options?. An important thing to consider is that attending virtual school can spark higher academic success in students.</span></p>

Going to school from one’s laptop, can allow one to stay focused for longer periods of time because since they are sitting down and going to school virtually, they don’t need to walk, talk, or move as often as they need to do in face to face school. When attending school virtually, there is a significantly less amount of background noise when students are doing their work and attending class. This can boost concentration in students because with less background noise, there is more room for increased concentration. To make things even better, when students attend virtual school, they are dialed into the lesson. There is no large classroom to look around at different things, there is simply  zoom meeting with a teacher presenting important academic information. So, when students stay at home, their concentration is sharpened as they go to school form their laptop.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; line-height:120%;"><span style=" font-family:'Leelawadee UI'; font-size:18pt; font-weight:600; color:#000000; background-color:transparent;">With school being online, a student can spend their time finishing up a new assignment or assessment from their teacher more often than in face to face school. In face to face school, students are not always given the option to stay inside their classroom to finish up new assignments. Instead of that, they have to take a break and play outside. In virtual school, they are given the option to go outside during recess or to stay inside their home. This is  because they are not limited by the policies of the school building, but by the rules of their home so they can choose to catch up on unfinished work. So, if they have the ability to catch up on unfinished work more often in virtual school than in face-to-face school, then they can stay on top of their studies without worrying about deadlines. </span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; line-height:120%;"><span style=" font-family:'Leelawadee UI'; font-size:18pt; font-weight:600; color:#000000; background-color:transparent;">By doing homework on a computer, a student can choose between writing their answers for an assessment or test on a piece of paper, or through different softwares. Using a text-editor software on a computer to write out an english assignment is more efficient than using pencil and paper. This is because typing allows them to write faster and have more visually appealing handwriting than on hand. If they are able to complete their work faster and with more quality, their grades are sure to rise because of the advantages of completing their work on a computer. So, since virtual school gives students the ability to complete their work on a computer, students are able to produce higher quality work in a shorter period of time, hence better grades.</span></p>
