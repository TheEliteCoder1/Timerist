#### My Codebase Structure:
| Folder/File   | Purpose       
| ------------- |:-------------:
| Resource      | The Resource package is a utility composed of modules, classes, & functions that can help us easily break down implementations for GUI. 
| database      | A folder database that handles the notes created by the user in the application.      
| images        | A folder that contains image resources for the application.
| README.md     | A markdown file describing our application, and the underlying source code that works behind the scenes to help the user organize their day at school.
| alarm.gif     | A gif file that is played when one of the tasks that the user has created in the "to do" section, has not been completed by the assigned date and time.
